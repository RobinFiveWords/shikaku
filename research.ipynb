    "I saw my kid playing <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=VAdmJ525lXY\">Stitch.</a>, so naturally I wanted to write a solver for it. If I understand correctly, the game is based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikaku\">Shikaku</a>:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Shikaku is played on a rectangular grid. Some of the squares in the grid are numbered. The objective is to divide the grid into rectangular $\\dots$ pieces such that each piece contains exactly one number, and that number represents the area of the rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to consistently use terms as follows:\n",
    "- **Grid** is used as described above and refers to the puzzle as presented to the player. It is composed of squares and contains numbers but not rectangles.\n",
    "- **Square** refers to an individual cell in the grid.\n",
    "- **Rectangle** refers to a solid rectangle formed by one or more squares.\n",
    "- **Number** refers to one of the numbers in the grid. It resides in a particular square and in a solution is associated with a particular rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thoughts about a solver\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following will be more efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "- choosing as the next step in the search a particular square containing a number, or a particular square regardless of whether it contains a number, in either case finding all possible rectangles containing that square\n",
    "- if choosing only squares with numbers — starting from larger numbers, or smaller numbers, or prime numbers, or numbers with the most factors\n",
    "- choosing a next step adjacent to or distant from the previous step\n",
    "- starting from the inside or the outside\n",
    "- breadth-first search or depth-first search\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, would doing all four corners first be more efficient? Walking the perimeter? Starting from the largest numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, what should I compute in advance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which numbers' rectangle could overlap with a given square?\n",
    "- Should I skip right to which rectangles could overlap with a given square?\n",
    "- Is it practical to cache results for a given partial solution?\n",
    "- Are there arrangements of numbers that can be efficiently reduced into their possible combinations of rectangles? (My gut says no, not efficiently.)\n",
    "\n",
    "How large of a grid am I willing to consider? How high of numbers will I allow?\n",
    "\n",
    "And I quickly realized that generating sample grids is not at all trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thoughts about grid generation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have the sense that attempting to generate a \"random\" grid is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZBwsm6B280\">almost a meaningless statement</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how many possible 2 $\\times$ 2 grids there are. For any given collection of rectanges, each rectangle's number $n$ could have been be placed in any of the $n$ squares within the rectangle. This means the quantity of grids produced by any given collection of rectangles is equal to the product of the rectangles' areas, or numbers, less any duplication that may occur from different collections of rectangles producing the same grid. These are the possible combinations of rectangle areas and how many distinct ways they can occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (4,) — 1 distinct partition\n",
    "- (2, 2) — 2 distinct partitions, vertically or horizontally\n",
    "- (2, 1, 1) — 4 distinct partitions, as the 2 can be vertical or horizontal and in the first or second row/column\n",
    "- (1, 1, 1, 1) — 1 distinct partition\n",
    "\n",
    "These suggest 21 total grids from these 8 distinct partitions, but only 19 of the grids are distinct. In the (2, 2) case, the numbers can be on a diagonal whether the rectangles are vertical or horizontal, so instead of $(2 \\times 2) \\times 2 = 8$ there are only 6 distinct grids from this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, that's 19 distinct grids from 8 distinct partitions, and most of these partitions have a significant number of rectangles of size 1. (My kid says size 1 is allowed, but I haven't seen this in the examples I've found online.) I imagine that grids-to-partitions ratio may grow as the size of the grid grows. And even if it doesn't, <a href=\"https://oeis.org/A333476\">OEIS A333476</a> indicates that there are over 84 million distinct partitions for a $5 \\times 5$ rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting back to grid generation — what would a \"random $5 \\times 5$ grid\" mean? Would it mean generating all 84 million distinct partitions, and all their however-many distinct grids, and then randomly selecting one? That's not a practical approach. It's also probably misguided. To the extent that there is some real \"population\" of grids that I would try to make my solver efficient at solving, those grids would have been created by some algorithm, and I'd effectively be trying to figure out what that algorithm might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps as I go about testing my own algorithms for grid generation, I can evaluate them with statistics. It's not clear to me whether on average I should expect the locations of numbers to be uniformly distributed throughout the grid, but I would expect numbers to be equally likely between symmetrical positions. For example, there shouldn't be a bias toward the upper-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I may be able to find enough examples of puzzles intended for humans to solve that I can establish a preference for the relative frequency of different numbers. On average there should probably be more 3s than 9s, but how much more? Should there be more 7s or 8s?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm also interested in how many solutions a grid has. One of my favorite puzzle games, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_Free\">Flow Free</a>, seems to limit its puzzles to those with a unique solution. I wonder whether, for example, the numbers in a grid, or their positions, may be correlated with how many solutions the grid has. And then by tweaking the generation algorithm, I would be more likely to create grids with very few or very many solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a solver. Make it quantifiably better.\n",
    "- Write a grid generator. Make it statistically defensible.\n",
    "- Analyze the number of solutions for various grids. Tweak the generator as desired without losing its statistical defensibility."

    "I've decided I will only consider rectangles of size 2 or greater, partly because this seems to be the convention for published puzzles. Size 1 rectangles are equivalent to holes in the grid (or free spaces). Handling non-rectangular grids or grids with holes feels like a straightforward enhancement of what I'll eventually build, but I'm more interested in fine-tuning the algorithm and analyzing the statistics, so I don't know that I'll get to it. But if I do, it's effectively the same as a rectangular puzzle with the number 1 everywhere within the bounding box but outside the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a big part of making the eventual algorithm efficient will be checking whether two rectangles overlap, or whether a rectangle contains a particular square. I'll be using Python, but any use of lists or tuples or even NumPy arrays will be very slow. Bitwise operations in Python are very fast, so a more efficient approach is to use a bit mask. Any rectangle or collection of rectangles overlaps a collection of squares. We can represent whether it overlaps any given square with just one bit: 1 for yes, 0 for no. If all squares in the grid are always considered in the same order, those bits can be interpreted as a binary number. If there is any bit that is set to 1 in both of the binary numbers representing two objects, the objects both contain the square associated with that bit and therefore the two objects overlap. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Compute all pairs of factors $(x,y)$ such that $x \\times y = n$. For $n = 6$ these pairs would be $(1,6)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,2)$, $(6,1)$.\n",
    "- For each pair of factors, consider each rectangle of that shape that overlaps with the sqaure containing the number.\n",
    "- Any rectangle that overlaps another number is not possible.\n",

    "From continuing research, I've gathered that a proper shikaku puzzle should have a single solution, and not even require backtracking once the right break-in is found. That's fine, but what interests me here isn't just how to solve a particular type of puzzle but rather how to generate scenarios with certain statistical properties that lead to accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, generating some scenarios, i.e. some puzzles. To implement a randomized generator, I might start from the topmost and then leftmost empty square and randomly (and probably *not* uniformly) choose the size and shape of rectangle with that square at its top-left. I would have to backtrack if I were left with no option other than a $1 \\times 1$ square, although I feel like that would only happen on the bottom row. (How does one backtrack and try other options without repetition when selecting randomly?) I have a feeling that this approach would tend to produce \"lopsided\" puzzles, or perhaps would tend to produce exact covers (I may be misusing that term; the collection of rectangles) that are more likely or less likely to lead to puzzles with a larger number of solutions. I should definitely implement this to assess the statistical properties, once I have figured out how to measure them.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I want to do tonight is write a randomizer that takes an existing collection of rectangles, randomly places each rectangle's number in any square of that rectangle, solves the resulting puzzle, and counts the solutions. At first I won't worry about the details of the solutions or even the puzzles, just the total counts."

    "That 2 is predominant makes me think there is some small area responsible, and looking back at the original Wikipedia puzzle, I imagine it is the 2s in the ninth column.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a bit surprised that 44 appears but neither 11 nor 22 does. That could just be due to randomness. Curiously, 16 + 28 = 44, and I wonder whether if all possible randomizations were generated, would there be some rule for the counts, like would every count greater than one have to equal the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) smaller counts among the results? I could investigate this with smaller grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thought for tonight — I'm curious how sensitive the puzzle is to being perturbed rather than fully randomized. If only one or two or three numbers were moved, would that affect the number of solutions? Which numbers are sensitive? In a general sense, is this likely to provide predictive value? Is this the opposite of what I'm trying to think about when generating scenarios?"

In other words, this rectangle does not extend farther right than the dead-end square.
